🏦 Banking System in C++

A Banking System implemented in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
This project simulates basic banking operations such as customer and account management, deposits, withdrawals, fund transfers, and transaction history tracking.

It is designed for learning OOP concepts, academic projects, and practical system design practice.

✨ Features

Object-Oriented design with the following classes:

Customer

Account

Transaction

Create and manage customers and bank accounts

Deposit and withdraw money

Transfer funds between accounts

Automatic transaction history recording

View recent transactions

Display account details and balance

Menu-driven console interface

🛠️ Technologies Used

C++

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Standard Template Library (STL)

🧠 System Design Overview
🔹 Customer

Stores customer ID and name

Linked to a bank account

🔹 Account

Stores account number and balance

Handles deposit, withdrawal, and fund transfer

Maintains transaction history

🔹 Transaction
Stores transaction type, amount, and details

Used for transaction tracking and display

▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Banking-System.git
2.Navigate to the project directory:
cd Banking-System
3. Compile the program:
g++ banking_system.cpp -o banking
4. Run the executable:
./banking

🎯 Use Cases

Academic mini-projects

Understanding OOP concepts

Learning real-world system modeling

C++ programming practice

📈 Time & Space Complexity

Most operations run in O(1) time

Transaction history display runs in O(n)

Space complexity depends on number of transactions

🚀 Future Enhancements

Persistent storage using files or databases

User authentication and login system

Multiple accounts per customer

Interest calculation

Graphical User Interface (GUI)

📜 License

This project is open-source and free to use for educational purposes.
